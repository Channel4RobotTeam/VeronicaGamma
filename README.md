For the engineering physics competition course ENPH 253, students were tasked with building a fully-automated robot designed to complete a variety of challenges within a two minute time frame.

This repository contains the code used to run the robot on the competition surface. It was written in collaboration by Amber Donnelly and Paula Cameron.
